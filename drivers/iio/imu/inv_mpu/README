Description
===========
This document describes how to install the Invensense device driver into a
Linux kernel. The supported chips are listed in Kconfig and user selects an
appropriate one from .e.g. menuconfig.


Integrating the Driver in the Linux Kernel
==========================================
Please add the files as follows:
- Copy mpu.h to <kernel_root>/include/linux/iio/imu/
- Copy inv_mpu folder under <kernel_root>/drivers/iio/imu/

In order to see the driver in menuconfig when building the kernel, please
make modifications as shown below:

    add "source "drivers/iio/imu/inv_mpu/Kconfig""
      in <kernel_root>/drivers/iio/imu/Kconfig

    add "obj-y += inv_mpu/"
      in <kernel_root>/drivers/iio/imu/Makefile


Dts file
========
In order to recognize the Invensense device on the I2C/SPI bus, dts (or dtsi)
file must be modified.

Example for ICM-42607/42670, ICM-42608/42671 (ICM-43600 driver):

On I2C bus:

&invn_i2c {
	icm42670@68 {
		compatible = "invensense,icm43600";
		reg = <0x68>;
		interrupt-parent = <&invn_gpio>;
		interrupts = <0 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>;
		inven,vdd_ana-supply = <&invn_vdd>;
		inven,vcc_i2c-supply = <&invn_vddio>;
		/* mount matrix */
		axis_map_x = <1>;
		axis_map_y = <0>;
		axis_map_z = <2>;
		negate_x = <0>;
		negate_y = <0>;
		negate_z = <1>;
		inven,secondary_type = "none";
		inven,aux_type = "none";
		inven,read_only_slave_type = "none";
	};
};


On SPI bus:

&invn_spi {
	icm42670@0 {
		compatible = "invensense,icm43600";
		reg = <0>;
		spi-max-frequency = <24000000>;
		inven,vdd_ana-supply = <&invn_vdd>;
		inven,vcc_i2c-supply = <&invn_vddio>;
		/* mount matrix */
		axis_map_x = <0>;
		axis_map_y = <1>;
		axis_map_z = <2>;
		negate_x = <1>;
		negate_y = <1>;
		negate_z = <0>;
		inven,secondary_type = "none";
		inven,aux_type = "none";
		inven,read_only_slave_type = "none";
	};
};


Communicating with the Driver in Userspace
==========================================
The driver generates several files in sysfs upon installation.
These files are used to communicate with the driver. The files can be found at:

(I2C) /sys/devices/*.i2c/i2c-*/*-*/iio:device*
(SPI) /sys/devices/*.spi/spi_master/spi*/spi*.*/iio:device*

Group and Owner for all entries should be updated to system/system at
boot time to allow userspace to access properly.
